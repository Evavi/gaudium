			<p><br />The four main categories include yellow, green, purple and red. The subtypes in these
			four groups all share the same cognitive functions.<br /><br /> A group of personalities is by no means
			similar to an untrained eye, unless of course the functions are in the same order. The opposite, actually. People of 
			the same group can have their functions in entirely the opposite order as another member of the same group. Still, the similarity
			between these group members is uncanny once you get into it. <br /><br />The best way to describe the connection is the concept of,
			for example, similar souls, or the hardcoded base code for an always developing and learning robot. <br /><br />People work in a similar way:
			we're hardwired to prefer specific cognitive functions over others, and some functions are in a way, our "favourite functions" to use.
			These are our dominant functions. The types are usually referred to as their two dominant functions in their preferred order.<br /><br />
